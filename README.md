Please be advised to look through and read the code thoroughly before making any changes.

I created three folders from the main branch. Let me explain their functions:
1. **Assets**: Where we will store our media and graphics (png, vector, svg, jpeg, etc.).
2. **Depository**: Features and template codes.
3. **Pages**: Where our individual tasks are done.

There are certain things you need to be aware of:
1. **Depository Folder**: Do not edit this folder unless you have been asked and permitted to do so. This is to avoid logic errors and maintain the integrity of the features.
2. **Comments in HTML and CSS**: Please read the comments in the HTML and CSS files. I have indicated where you will work on your pages. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to approach me. <3
3. **Code Testing**: Before pushing your code into the branch/repository, please run the code several times. Ensure it maintains functionality without compromising its features.
4. **Error-Free Code**: Make sure your code is error-free. If any issues occur, please let us know in the group chat so that anyone can help you.
5. **Enjoy the Project**: Lastly, enjoy this project! Blast some music or have a snack while coding. Let's have fun and learn together!
