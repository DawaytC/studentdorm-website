Hello!

Please be advised that look and read through the codes, and try to
understand them before making any changes.

I created three folders from the main branch,
let me explain their function.
  1. Assets : Where we will store our media and graphics (png, vector, svg, jpeg, etc).
  2. Depository : features and template codes
  3. Pages : Our individual tasks are done here.

There are certain things that you have to be aware of
  1. Do note that the depository folder should not be edited unless you are asked and permitted to - this is to avoid logic errors, and ruining the features.
  2. Please red the comments in html and css, i have indicated their where you will work on your pages, if you have any questions, or concerns, please don't hesitate to appreach me yeh <3
  3. Before pushing your codes into the branch / repository, please run the code several times. Ensure the it has the same functionality without compromising its features.
  4. Also make sure that your code is error-free, if it occurs, please let us know in the groupchat so that anyone of us can help you
  5. Lastly, please enjoy this project! Blast some music and or eat while you are doing your code. Let's have fun and learn together!

All the best!
Selamat Pagi <3
